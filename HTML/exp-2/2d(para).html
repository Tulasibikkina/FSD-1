  <h2>About The Moon</h2>
  <p>
    This image shows a stunning view of the Moon — Earth's only natural satellite. 
    The Moon appears in its full phase, glowing brightly against the dark night sky.
    The craters and maria (dark plains) are clearly visible, revealing its ancient and mysterious surface.

    The background of the image features deep space shades of black and navy blue with scattered stars, 
    enhancing the Moon’s silvery-white appearance. The overall presentation symbolizes calmness, wonder, 
    and the beauty of the universe as seen from Earth.
